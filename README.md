# ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Algorithms & Datasets â€“ Learning Guide

Welcome to your machine learning learning path! This guide is tailored for practitioners with a solid background in statistics and math, aiming to master classical ML techniques through curated algorithms and real-world datasets.

Each category (Classification, Regression, Clustering, and Dimensionality Reduction) includes:
- A progression of **Core** algorithms (learn in order)
- **Advanced** options to explore further
- One high-quality dataset for hands-on experimentation

## ðŸŸ© Classification

### âœ… Core Algorithms
1. **Logistic Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**
4. **Naive Bayes**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
6. **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**

### ðŸš€ Advanced
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset:** [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) â€” Images of 10 object classes.  
**ðŸ’¡ Note:** Start by flattening images or using PCA, then apply classic models before jumping to CNNs.

## ðŸŸ¨ Regression

### âœ… Core Algorithms
1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Ridge & Lasso Regression**
3. **Decision Trees**
4. **Random Forest**
5. **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
6. **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP)**

### ðŸš€ Advanced
- **k-Nearest Neighbors Regressor**

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset:** [Boston Housing Prices](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/toy_dataset.html#boston-house-prices-dataset)  
**ðŸ’¡ Note:** Ideal for understanding bias-variance tradeoffs and regularization.

## ðŸŸ¦ Clustering

### âœ… Core Algorithms
1. **k-Means**
2. **Hierarchical Clustering**
3. **DBSCAN**
4. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**
5. **Spectral Clustering**

### ðŸš€ Advanced
- **t-SNE + Clustering**
- **PCA Preprocessing** *(preprocessing step, not a clustering method)*

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset:** [COIL-20](http://www.cs.columbia.edu/CAVE/software/softlib/coil-20.php) â€” Gray-scale images of 20 objects.  
**ðŸ’¡ Note:** Use PCA or t-SNE before clustering for better performance.

## ðŸŸª Dimensionality Reduction

### âœ… Core Algorithms
1. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
2. **t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)**
3. **Locally Linear Embedding (LLE)**
4. **Isomap**

### ðŸš€ Advanced
- **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)**
- **Autoencoders**
- **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)**

**ðŸ“‚ Dataset:** [Olivetti Faces](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/real_world.html#olivetti-faces) â€” Facial images of 40 individuals.  
**ðŸ’¡ Note:** Great for visualization and compression of high-dimensional face data.

## ðŸ§  Final Thoughts

These datasets were selected to support the development of deep, intuitive understanding of classical ML techniques. While deep learning is dominant in many areas today, mastering these algorithms will give you a solid foundation for understanding and innovating with more complex models later.

Feel free to contribute to this repo with Jupyter notebooks, visualizations, or extensions to deep learning methods using the same datasets.

Happy learning! ðŸš€
